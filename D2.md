## Service Containerization (Implementation & Deployment Decisions)

- Chosen approach to containerize must have services.

  1. Docker is used to containerize the services
  2. Docker compose is used to run multiple docker containers locally

- Deployment workflow and CI/CD considerations.
- Alignment with scalability and production readiness.

1. Implementation tech stack: language/runtime versions, package
   manager, framework; base image choice; Dockerfile strategy,
   dependency/security scanning, image tagging/versioning.
2. Configuration & secrets: env vars, secret management (e.g.,
   SSM/Secrets Manager/K8s Secrets)
3. Networking & ingress: service-to-service comms, ingress/controller
   choice, ports, API gateway/ingress rules.
4. CI/CD & rollout: pipeline stages (build→test→scan→push→deploy),
   promotion flow (dev→staging→prod), rollout strategy (rolling/blue
   green/canary), rollback plan.
5. Observability: logs/metrics/traces, health checks (liveness/readiness),
   dashboards & alerts.
